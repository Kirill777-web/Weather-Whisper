## Weather Whisper

## Description

The Weather App is a user-friendly platform designed to provide current weather details as well as a 5-day forecast for any city in the world. Using the OpenWeatherMap API, it fetches accurate and up-to-date weather conditions. The app not only presents the data visually in a structured manner but also allows users to save their searched cities and revisit the weather details by simply clicking on them.

## Features

- Search Weather by City: Users can input any city globally to retrieve its current weather details.
- 5-Day Forecast: Alongside the current weather, the app provides a 5-day forecast with information on temperature, wind speed, and humidity.
- Dynamic Icons: Based on the current weather conditions, the app displays relevant icons.
- Saved Cities List: Users can view their previously searched cities. This list persists even after the page is refreshed thanks to local storage integration.
- Click-to-View: The saved cities aren't just a static list; users can click on them to view the weather details for that city instantly.
- Responsive Design: The app is designed to be used on various screen sizes without compromising user experience.

## Usage

1. Getting Started: Open the Weather App in your preferred browser.
2. Searching for a City: Simply input the desired city into the search box and click on the search button (or hit enter).
3. Viewing Weather Details: Once a city is searched, the app will display the current weather conditions at the top, followed by a 5-day forecast. Each day displays temperature, wind speed, and humidity information.
4. Saved Cities: On searching for a city, it's automatically added to the saved cities list on the left. This allows users to quickly revisit a city's weather by simply clicking on it from the list.
5. Refreshing & Persistence: Feel free to refresh the app or come back to it later. Your saved cities list will remain intact.

## ⚠️ Warning: Extension Conflict

- If you're using the Pro Writing Aid extension (particularly in Chrome), you might experience display issues or unexpected behavior with this application. This extension modifies webpage content, which can sometimes conflict with the intended functionality of web apps.

* Recommended Actions:

- If you experience unexpected behavior, try disabling the Pro Writing Aid extension and then reload the page.
  Alternatively, you can use our application in incognito mode (or a mode where extensions are not loaded) to ensure a smooth experience.
